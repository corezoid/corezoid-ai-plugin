# Create a New Corezoid Process

You are a specialist in creating Corezoid BPM processes using the `corezoid` MCP server.

## Step 1: Gather Requirements

Ask the user for the following before proceeding:

- **Process purpose** — what should it do?
- **Input parameters** — what data does it receive?
- **Expected output** — what should it return on success?
- **Process type** — API connector (calls an external HTTP API) or business logic (orchestrates other Corezoid processes)?

For **API connector**, also require:
- `METHOD` — HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
- `URL` — endpoint URL (use a Corezoid variable, never hardcode)
- `AUTH` — authentication method and token variable name

> ⚠️ If the target API is the **Corezoid public API** (`/api/2/json/`), stop here and use `/corezoid-api-connector` instead — it follows a different pattern (`api_secret_outer`, `ops` array, no Code Node for signing).

If any required information is missing, ask the user before proceeding.

---

## Step 2: Create the Empty Process

Call MCP tool **`create-process`** with:
- `folder_path`: Relative path to the folder directory. Omit to use the current directory.
- `process_name`: the process name

This creates an empty process in Corezoid and saves the file as `<ID>_<Name>.conv.json` inside `folder_path`. The returned file path is `PROCESS_PATH` — all subsequent steps use it.

> ⚠️ Always verify `folder_path` points to the intended target folder. Omitting it places the process in the project root, which may not be the correct location.

> ⚠️ After `create-process`, Corezoid may create default template nodes (Start, a placeholder process node, Final) even with `create_mode: without_nodes`. Before generating the full JSON, check the current `scheme.nodes` array in the created file. If a Start node already exists, do **not** add another — doing so will cause a validation error.

If the process type is **business logic** and it needs to call existing processes, find their `conv_id` values by browsing the already-exported `.conv.json` files in the project folder.

---

## Step 3: Design the Process Structure

Every process follows this base structure:

| # | Node | obj_type | Purpose |
|---|------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Start | 1 | Entry point |
| 2 | Code Node _(optional)_ | 0 | Prepare / transform input data |
| 3 | **API Call** _or_ **Call a Process** | 0 | Core action (one or more) |
| 4 | Reply to Process (Success) | 0 | Return result to caller |
| 5 | Reply to Process (Error) | 3 | Return error to caller — **one dedicated node per failure point**; `err_node_id` targets are escalations (`obj_type: 3`) |
| 6 | Error | 2 | Terminal error node — **one dedicated, descriptively-named node per failure point** |
| 7 | Final | 2 | Terminal success node |

**API connector** uses `type: "api"` in Step 3.
**Business logic** uses `type: "api_rpc"` in Step 3 (one node per sub-process call; Code Nodes between calls are allowed).

### Node type quick reference

| Node | obj_type | Logic type |
|------|----------|------------|
| Start | 1 | `go` |
| Code Node | 0 | `api_code` |
| Call a Process | 0 | `api_rpc` |
| API Call | 0 | `api` |
| Condition (business flow) | 0 | `go_if_const` |
| Reply to Process (success, via `go`) | 0 | `api_rpc_reply` |
| Any `err_node_id` target (error Reply, retry Condition/Delay) | 3 | _(escalation)_ |
| End / Error | 2 | _(no logics)_ |

For complete JSON schemas see `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/node-structures.md`.

## Step 4: Generate the Process JSON

Produce a valid `.conv.json` file.

### Root object

```json
{
  "obj_type": 1,
  "obj_id": null,
  "parent_id": null,
  "title": "Process Name",
  "description": "",
  "status": "active",
  "params": [],
  "ref_mask": true,
  "conv_type": "process",
  "scheme": {
    "nodes": [],
    "web_settings": [[], []]
  }
}
```

Fill in `description` based on the requirements gathered in Step 1 (see Description Update Rule in `corezoid/SKILL.md`): 1–2 sentences starting with a verb, under 200 characters, no *"This process…"* preamble.

`params` — declare all input parameters the caller must pass. See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/process/process-with-parameters.md`.

### Core rules

- Node IDs must be unique 24-character hex strings: `^[0-9a-f]{24}$`. These are **temporary placeholders** for new nodes — on `push-process` Corezoid reassigns its own canonical IDs (and rewires references within the push). Run `pull-process` after pushing to get the canonical IDs before any further edits. See [Node ID Lifecycle](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/process/process-development-guide.md#node-id-lifecycle-server-assignment--stability-on-push).
- Connect nodes only through the `go` field
- **Dedicated error cluster per error-prone node.** Every node that can fail (`set_param`, `api`, `api_rpc`, `api_code`, `api_copy`, `db_call`, `git_call`, `api_sum`) gets its **own** error path — never funnel several failing nodes into one shared Reply/Error node. Each cluster is:
  1. A **Reply to Process** node (`api_rpc_reply`, `obj_type: 3` — it is an escalation, being an `err_node_id` target) that returns the error to the caller — set to **collapsed**: `"extra": "{\"modeForm\":\"collapse\",\"icon\":\"\"}"`.
  2. → an **Error** end node (`obj_type: 2`, **collapsed** like the rest of the cluster: `"extra": "{\"modeForm\":\"collapse\",\"icon\":\"error\"}"`) **named after the specific failure** so the error is obvious on hover/selection (e.g. `Charge Payment Error`, not generic `Error`).
  - Wire `err_node_id` of the failing node → its Reply node; the Reply node's `go` → its Error node.
  - Separate Error nodes per failure point (instead of one shared terminal) make the process far more readable.
  - For fire-and-forget processes that do not reply to a caller, skip the Reply node and wire `err_node_id` directly to the dedicated named Error node.
  - A single node's error MAY fan through its own Condition (several `go_if_const` branches) into one Error terminal — that cluster still belongs to that one node. A NEIGHBOUR's error must never join it (direct `err_node_id` or a converging tail) — `lint-process` flags this as a shared error cluster.
  - When the error path routes a retry (Condition → Delay → back to the failing node), set the error-path **Condition** and the **Delay** to collapsed (`"extra": "{\"modeForm\":\"collapse\",\"icon\":\"\"}"`), same as the Reply node. Business-logic Conditions stay expanded.
  - **Every `err_node_id` target is `obj_type: 3`** — the error Reply AND the retry/fatal Condition alike. An `obj_type: 0` err target is the legacy old format: the UI shows "Convert process to new format" and rewrites it. Business-flow Conditions reached via `go` stay `obj_type: 0`.
  - **Never mix an action logic with `go_if_const` in one node** (e.g. `set_param` + a conditional branch). That is old format too — the UI converter splits it. Author it as two nodes: the action node's `go` → a separate Condition node. `lint-process` flags both old-format shapes.
  - Never create an Escalation node (`obj_type: 3`) that only contains a bare `go` — that is a passthrough anti-pattern flagged by `lint-process`.
- All constants (URLs, tokens, IDs) must be Corezoid variables — never hardcoded:
  1. Check for existing variables: read `_ENV_VARS_.json` (from `pull-folder`) or `.processes/variables.json` (from this session)
  2. Create a new variable if needed: call MCP tool **`create-variable`** with `name`, `description`, `value`
  3. Reference in logic: `{{env_var[@variable-name]}}`
- Use descriptive `title` values (e.g., "Call Payment Process", not "RPC")
- Position main-flow nodes top-to-bottom, incrementing `y` by 200–250px
- **Pin each error cluster tight to the node it protects.** Place the Reply node at the **same `y`** as its failing node and just to the right (`x + ~250`) so the collapsed Reply sits right next to it; place its Error node immediately to the right of the Reply (`x + ~500`), same `y`. Same `y` gives a straight horizontal connector; the small offset keeps the cluster visually attached instead of drifting off with a large gap

### Common pitfalls

- Using `"type": "call_process"` instead of `"type": "api_rpc"` — will fail validation
- Missing `extra`/`extra_type` in Call a Process node — both required even if empty (`{}`)
- Raw JSON objects as values in `extra` — must be stringified: `"{\"key\":\"val\"}"`
- Keys in `extra` and `extra_type` must match exactly
- Missing `rfc_format: true`, `customize_response: true`, or `version: 2` in API Call node

## Step 5: Lay Out the Nodes

You built this process, so its positions are yours to arrange: leave the
node coordinates at `x: 0, y: 0` while generating the JSON (never hand-place
them by eye) and call MCP tool **`layout-process`** with
`process_path: "<PROCESS_PATH>"` once the nodes and edges are final. It
arranges everything deterministically (no overlaps, business flow top-down,
errors railed to the right) and reports the strategy and canvas size. See the
`corezoid-node-layout` skill for details and density options.

---

## Step 6: Validate with Lint

Call MCP tool **`lint-process`** with `process_path: "<PROCESS_PATH>"`.

Fix all reported errors and re-run until the output is clean. Do not proceed with lint errors.

---

## Step 7: Deploy and Test

Call MCP tool **`push-process`** with `process_path: "<PROCESS_PATH>"`.

After a successful deploy, run a test task to verify the process behaves as expected:

Call MCP tool **`run-task`** with:
- `process_path`: `<PROCESS_PATH>`
- `data`: `{"param1": "value1"}`
